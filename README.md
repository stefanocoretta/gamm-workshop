# An introduction to GAM(M)s

## Software pre-requisites

Please, have the following software installed on your laptop.

- R (latest version): <https://www.r-project.org>
    - If for other software constraints reasons you cannot upgrade to the latest version, anything > 3.3.3 should work
- RStudio (latest version): <https://posit.co/downloads/>
- The following `R` packages, available on CRAN:
    - `tidyverse`
    - `mgcv`
- The following package available on GitHub (install the development version)
    - `tidygam`: <https://github.com/stefanocoretta/tidygam>

Be sure to update all of your other `R` packages.
